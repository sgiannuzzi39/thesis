Title: Untitled 7

In the gentle embrace of twilight that blanketed the small New England town of Alderidge, old Mrs. Mallory sat on her creaky wooden porch, wrapped snugly in a hand-knit shawl, the air crisp with the scent of turning leaves. She watched with muted curiosity as the last children, their faces masked by the shadows of dusk and their Halloween costumes, scampered across the leaf-strewn streets gathering the tail end of their treats.

Mrs. Mallory had witnessed many Halloweens, each fading into the next, but this one was special—it was to be her last in the old Victorian house she'd inhabited since birth. Tomorrow, she would leave for a retirement community in Florida, trading her view of picturesque autumns for swaying palms and sandy beaches.

The sun dipped below the horizon, dragging the last light of day with it, and she stood, her bones protesting, to retreat inside. That’s when she saw it—a small, shadowy figure standing at the bottom of her garden, near the old birch tree. As she squinted into the twilight, the figure seemed to flicker, then vanish, as if it were made of smoke.

“Just a trick of the light,” she muttered to herself, shaking her graying head, dismissing the creeping unease. She turned and went inside, where the warmth of her house greeted her like an old friend.

That night, as the wind whispered through the skeletal branches of trees, Mrs. Mallory lay in bed, unable to sleep. The image of the shadowy figure nagged at her, festering in her mind like a splinter. Finally, unable to bear the tick of the old grandfather clock any longer, she rose and went downstairs to make some tea.

As she passed the living room window, something caught her eye—a flicker of movement in the garden. She paused, heart tightening, and peered out. There, under the same old birch tree, was the figure again, distinctly child-like, with what seemed like an impossibly old, tear-stained face.

This time, Mrs. Mallory couldn't dismiss it as a trick of the light. She threw on a coat over her nightgown, grabbed a flashlight, and stepped out into the chilly night air. Her shoes crunched over dry leaves as she approached the figure, her flashlight beam trembling in her unsteady hand.

As she drew closer, the figure turned to her, its eyes hollow, its mouth a gash of despair. Mrs. Mallory gasped, nearly dropping the flashlight. "Who are you?" she demanded, her voice more steady than she felt. "What do you want?"

The figure pointed towards the birch tree, or rather, to the ground beneath it. Mrs. Mallory's beam followed the direction of the pointing finger, illuminating the gnarled roots and the earth around them. She frowned, puzzled. "Are you trying to tell me something about the tree?"

The figure nodded, then faded like morning mist, leaving Mrs. Mallory alone with the whispering trees and her pounding heart. She stood frozen, unsure of her next move.

Morning found her in a state of unrest; the encounter had felt too vivid to dismiss as a dream. After a restless breakfast, she called her neighbor, Tom Jenkins, who was also the local handyman.

“Tom, can you come over? I need help digging up something around the old birch tree,” she had said, trying to keep her voice light.

Tom arrived, his face creased with concern. “Everything alright, Mrs. Mallory?”

She responded with a concocted half-truth. “Oh, just thought I’d plant something new before I leave. A little goodbye gift to the old place.”

With a nod, Tom set to work, his shovel biting into the earth with methodical thunks. Mrs. Mallory watched, every scoop of dirt tightening the knot in her stomach. What if this was all just a flight of fancy? An old woman's mind playing tricks?

Yet, when the shovel clinked against something hard, her heart leapt. Tom bent down, brushing away the dirt, revealing the corner of a small, metal box. With each scrape, more of the box was uncovered, until finally, it lay fully exposed, adorned with intricate carvings that shimmered in the sunlight.

Tom and Mrs. Mallory exchanged a look of mixed awe and confusion. With reverent hands, Tom lifted the box and handed it to Mrs. Mallory.

“It’s locked,” she noted, examining the delicate lock that seemed to mock her with its silence.

“I might have something to open it,” Tom said, always prepared, and fetched a set of old lock-picking tools from his truck.

The lock gave way with an almost inaudible click, and the lid swung open. Inside, nestled on a bed of worn velvet, lay a medallion attached to a heavy gold chain. The medallion was engraved with the same pattern as the box, symbols that neither Tom nor Mrs. Mallory recognized.

Mrs. Mallory picked up the medallion, feeling a strange warmth spread through her fingers. The symbols seemed to dance before her eyes, telling a story too ancient for her to understand. Yet, she felt a profound sense of sadness emanating from the piece, as if it mourned long-lost days.

“What do you suppose this is?” Tom asked, peering over her shoulder.

“I don’t know,” Mrs. Mallory murmured, “but I think it’s important. It feels important.”

Determined to uncover the mystery of the medallion and the child-like figure, Mrs. Mallory decided to visit the local library. Maybe there, in the musty tomes of history, she could find a clue about the origins of her unearthed treasure.

The library was a comfortable maze of high shelves and whispering patrons. Mrs. Mallory approached the librarian, a young woman named Claire who was well-versed in the town's history.

“I found something strange in my yard,” Mrs. Mallory began, unveiling the medallion. “Do you know what this might be, or where it could have come from?”

Claire examined the medallion, her brow furrowed. “I’ve seen these symbols before,” she said slowly, “in the old town records. They’re associated with the founding families of Alderidge. This could be a significant historical find, Mrs. Mallory.”

Elated yet bewildered, Mrs. Mallory listened as Claire suggested they examine some of the oldest ledgers and books that detailed the early days of Alderidge. Together, they delved into the yellowed pages of history, unaware that the shadows outside lengthened as the sun dipped below the horizon once again, signaling the end of another day. The search was just beginning, and Mrs. Mallory felt the edges of the past curling around her, ready to reveal secrets that had been buried under time and soil.

Amidst the musty scent of aged paper and the faint creaks of the library’s wooden floorboards, Claire and Mrs. Mallory hunched over a large, leather-bound ledger. Its pages were delicate and worn, filled with elegant script that told of the township’s early years. The glow from the desk lamp cast a yellowed light, making the ancient texts appear even more otherworldly.

“There!” Claire pointed to a passage, her voice a whisper of excitement. “Look, Mrs. Mallory, it mentions a medallion passed down through the generations. It was believed to protect the town from misfortune.”

Mrs. Mallory leaned in closer, her eyes tracing the lines that seemed to dance with revelations. “This says it was last known to be in the possession of Jeremiah Alder, one of the original settlers,” she read aloud, her finger underlining the name.

“Jeremiah Alder…” Claire mused, flipping through another book swiftly. “There’s a bit more here. It looks like the Alder family experienced some kind of tragedy. A fire, it says, that claimed the lives of several family members. After that, the medallion disappears from the records.”

A chill ran down Mrs. Mallory’s spine as she absorbed the weight of the words. “Could it be that the medallion was thought lost in the fire, but someone—perhaps Jeremiah himself—hid it instead?”

“That’s a possibility,” Claire agreed, her eyes alight with the thrill of historical detective work. “And whoever hid it must have wanted it to be found by someone who could uncover its meaning.”

Mrs. Mallory felt a deep connection to the medallion resting in her pocket. She pulled it out again, letting it catch the light. The symbols seemed to pulse with an energy, as if eager to end their centuries of silence.

“I need to find out more about the Alder family, especially the children,” Mrs. Mallory decided, her voice firm with newfound purpose. “Maybe this medallion was meant to be found now for a reason.”

Over the following days, Mrs. Mallory and Claire dove into the archives, piecing together fragments of Alderidge’s past. They uncovered old maps, diary entries, and letters that hinted at hidden aspects of the town’s history.

As Mrs. Mallory learned more about the Alders, she grew increasingly convinced that the shadowy figure was connected. “Perhaps it was one of the Alder children,” she pondered one afternoon, the library’s golden light washing over her. “Maybe they’re unable to rest because of the medallion’s loss.”

One rainy afternoon, as the wind howled outside the library windows, Claire found an old photograph tucked in a forgotten drawer. It depicted the Alder family, with Jeremiah and his wife surrounded by their children. One child, a boy with sad eyes, held a familiar object—it was unmistakably the medallion.

Mrs. Mallory gasped, her fingers trembling as she traced the outline of the photograph. “This boy,” she said, her voice soft but filled with a mix of awe and sorrow. “I think he’s the one who’s been appearing to me.”

With a renewed sense of responsibility, Mrs. Mallory decided to hold a small ceremony under the birch tree. She invited Claire and Tom, who had become equally involved in the unfolding mystery. Together, with the chills of an early winter evening nipping at their skin, they gathered around the tree.

Mrs. Mallory placed the medallion back into its box and buried it gently beneath the tree, where it had been hidden for so long. “May this bring you peace,” she whispered into the twilight air, feeling the presence of the boy watching.

As they stood back, the wind seemed to carry a soft, whispering thank you through the branches.

The mystery of the medallion didn’t solve all the secrets that Alderidge held, but for Mrs. Mallory, it had brought a poignant closure to her time in the town. With her departure imminent, she felt a strange relief, as though she was leaving something important behind—not just a town, but a legacy of remembrance and peace.

The next morning, as she prepared to leave Alderidge, Mrs. Mallory took one last look at the old Victorian house and the birch tree standing solemnly in the yard. The air was crisp, and somewhere in the distance, children laughed, the sound carrying on the wind, mingling with the rustle of the leaves. It was, after all, a beautiful goodbye.
