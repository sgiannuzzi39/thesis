# thesis
This repository includes all relevant code drafted for "Evaluating AI as Author: An Analysis of AI-Generated Short Stories," a thesis submitted to Harvard English Department by Sofia Giannuzzi in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Bachelor’s Degree with Honors.

This repository contains three main folders.

The first folder, entitled "crawlers," contains the scripts that were utilized to scrape short stories from online platforms, including:
- This The New Yorker website (garnering additional stories by clicking “Next Page”): https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/fiction
- This list of 100 Great Short Stories: https://americanliterature.com/100-great-short-stories/
- This “Classic Short Stories’ site: https://classicshorts.com/
Stories were also collected from this Tin House archive, though they were collected manually: https://tinhouse.com/category/fiction/.
