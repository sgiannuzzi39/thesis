Title: Farewell to the Wind

Once upon a time on the outskirts of the quaint little town of Aulari, set on the canvas of the luscious green woods, was a small community of frail, singing willows. They were known throughout the land for their enchanting whispers, weaving ethereal tales and singing sweet, soothing lullabies. Among them stood the tallest and the oldest, Whistler. With his swaying branches and lustrous leaves, Whistler was always yearned to experience the world beyond his roots.

The four winds, North, South, East, and West loved the whispering willows dearly and would often spare a few playful moments with them. But out of them all, they loved Whistler’s music the most. The young trees watched in awe as the winds would come to dance in harmony with Whistler’s song.

As time slipped through the hands of the woods and the leaves turned gold and red, Whistler was getting old, and his melody got fainter day by day. Alarmed at this, the four winds raced to him, worried about his quietening song. With great concern, North wind, the soft-spoken one, asked Whistler, “Why has your song turned quiet, dear friend?”

Whistler, with his fading voice, replied, “Dear winds, I am growing old, my voice is growing frail. But more than that, my heart longs to see the world beyond, which I have only known through your amazing tales of distant lands and blue seas.”

Nothing pained the winds more than seeing their dear friend sad. Realizing his ultimate wish, they decided to carry one last song of Whistler to every corner of the world and bring back tales and tokens from the lands far beyond.

For many years, the winds traversed through the deserts, played with the waves of the ocean and rustled through vast fields. They brought back tales and tokens from all over the world and passed them to Whistler. The “music of the world” whispered through Whistler, entrancing every molecule of the air and every creature in the woods and the village nearby.

As the rhythm of his last mesmerizing melody reached its zenith, Whistler breathed his last, leaving behind the echo of the exquisite harmony. The four winds sang a requiem, and the entire woods mourned their loss.

In honor of him, every year when the leaves would fall, the winds would return to the village carrying stories from afar, lodging them into the new sprouts of young willows. The tradition continues even today; the winds bring tales, the willows sing, creating the enchanting murmurs in the forest of Aulari.

Thus ended the tale of Whistler, the singing willow, whose voice may have faded, but his echo was etched in the heart of the winds, traveling to the corners of the world. The inhabitants of Aulari, till date, remember Whistler as the willow who waves them a 'farewell' each time the winds pass by.
