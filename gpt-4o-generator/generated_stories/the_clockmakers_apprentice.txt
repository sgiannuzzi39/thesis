Title: The Clockmaker’s Apprentice

In a small, quaint town lived an old clockmaker named Enoch. He was known far and wide for his expertise in crafting mesmerizing clocks that gave the exact time. Enoch had an eighteen-year-old apprentice named Abel who was an orphan taken in by the craftsman when he was barely five.

Unlike the diligent master, Abel bore a lax, playful character. But deep down, he admired Enoch immensely and yearned to master the skill of clockmaking. Every day he observed the old man who was bent over his workbench, entranced in the world of gears, pendulums, dials, and hands, concentrating on minute failures and precision. His fingers, though wrinkled, moved with a grace that made every moment a masterstroke.

One dress rehearsal day, Enoch curiously announced that he was heading to the neighbouring town for a week and leaving the store in Abel's care. The old man’s sudden faith surprised Abel, but the thrill of being alone was more potent. Enoch, before leaving, pointed towards an unfinished clock and said, “Perfect it, Abel. Time waits for none.”

Once Enoch was gone, Abel was initially enthusiastic about his new assignment but soon started losing interest. Between playing with local kids and goofing around, he neglected the clock and the shop. Days passed, and on the last day of the week, he realized his mistake.

In a desperate attempt, he tried working on the clock, but his lack of practice and understanding made every attempt a failure. His hands couldn’t match the grace of Enoch’s, his comprehension fell short of the intricate design and meshwork of gears. Eventually, he fell asleep, the unsolved riddle of the clock echoing in his dreams.

When Abel woke up, sunlight was streaming into his eyes. Sitting on the chair at his worktable was Enoch, looking at him with a strange calmness. The first rays of the sun reflected on something astounding – the once-unfinished clock now glistening gloriously, its hands moving with perfect rhythm.

Enoch broke the silence, “Do you understand now, Abel? Time does not wait for anyone. Procrastination is the thief of time, and thus, we must give every minute the labor it deserves.”

Abel nodded, realizing the gravity of the lesson he had learned. From that day forward, Abel committed himself to mastering his craft, putting time and dedication into his work, honoring every second of the day.

Enoch, the wise old clockmaker, smiled to himself. He didn't just craft time-telling machines, he crafted a timeless lesson in the heart of a young boy, forever transforming him into a diligent timekeeper of his life. Hence, the clockmaker's apprentice not only learned the art of clockmaking but also the essence of life - respecting time.
