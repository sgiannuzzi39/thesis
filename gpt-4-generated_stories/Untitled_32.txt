Title: Untitled 32

The train was always late on Fridays. This was a fact learned over countless commutes, tucked behind the yellowing pages of a thriller or the flickering screen of his phone. Today was no exception. As the cold seeped through his threadbare coat, James stood on Platform 9, disposed to the rhythm of waiting that had woven itself into the fabric of his life.

He watched absentmindedly as his breath formed clouds in the chill air. It was fall in Hastings, and the platform was littered with the casualties of dead leaves, drifting occasionally with the passing breeze. The station was mostly empty; the kind of emptiness that fills up with the echoing announcements and the occasional screech of distant trains.

James shuffled his feet, tugged his scarf tighter, and glanced at his watch. The 5:45 to London Bridge was late by fifteen minutes and counting. Seeking refuge from the biting wind, he retreated into the old brick waiting room adorned with vintage travel posters promising sunshine and adventure.

As the door clanged shut behind him, he noticed her. She was seated at the far end of the room, lost in a large, fraying book. Her red hair was a stark contrast to her pale skin and the somber greys and blues of her attire. She seemed utterly absorbed, her eyes flitting across the pages with an intensity that intrigued him. It was rare to see anyone around here so engrossed in a book, especially one that looked as though it might crumble to dust if not handled with care.

Curiosity piqued, James moved closer, pretending to study the train schedule posted on the wall nearby. From this closer vantage, he could see the title of the book: "Echoes of the Past." It was an apt title, he thought, for such a weathered volume.

The woman must have felt his gaze because she suddenly looked up, her bright green eyes locking with his. James felt a flush of embarrassment and mumbled something about the delayed train.

"It’s always late on Fridays," she said, her voice a mixture of amusement and resignation.

"I know," James chuckled. "You’d think I’d have learned to bring a more interesting book by now."

Her eyes flickered to the thriller protruding from his coat pocket. "Or perhaps more delicate one," she replied with a smile, gesturing to her own antique tome.

He took a seat opposite her, curiosity overcoming his usual reticence. "What’s it about?"

"This?" She tapped the book's cover. "It’s a collection of local myths and legends. Stories from around Hastings and Sussex. Some of them, quite strange and eerie."

"Sounds fascinating," James said, and he meant it. In his line of work as a high school history teacher, stories—especially local ones—held a particular charm.

"It is." She marked her page and closed the book, her eyes still bright with the residue of otherworldly tales. "Do you live around here?"

"Yes, just a few blocks from the sea. And you?"

"Near the old church on Mercery Lane. I'm an archivist at the county records office."

That explained the historical interest, James thought. "I pass by there on my way to work. It’s a beautiful old building."

"Just like everything in Hastings, it’s steeped in history. You teach?"

"Yes, history, actually."

A genuine smile spread across her face. "Perfect. Maybe you can verify if some of these stories are based on fact or just old wives' tales."

He laughed. "I might just take you up on that challenge. It sounds more intriguing than grading essays on the Tudors."

They continued to chat, the conversation flowing effortlessly. When the announcement for the delayed train finally crackled through the speakers, both seemed surprised.

“That’s me,” James said, reluctant to end their meeting. “It was lovely talking to you.”

“The pleasure was mine,” she replied. “Maybe I’ll bring another book and catch you on another delayed Friday train.”

As he stepped back into the chill of the platform, James realized he hadn’t asked for her name. He turned back towards the waiting room, but she was gone, perhaps having caught her own train.

The train ride to London was uneventful, but James couldn’t shake the feeling of serendipity from his encounter. He thought about the way her eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, the easy laughter they shared, and the intrigue of the old myths she held in her hands. It was refreshing, he admitted to himself, to have such an engaging conversation with a stranger. He resolved to bring a better book next Friday, just in case.

All week, James found himself looking forward to the train ride. He picked out a book from his own collection, an old favorite about British folklore, and hoped it would catch her interest. Friday couldn't come quickly enough.

When it finally did, James felt an unfamiliar flutter of excitement as he walked to the station. He arrived earlier than usual, scanning the platform and waiting room for a hint of red hair or the sight of an ancient book. But she wasn’t there.

The 5:45 came and went, and with each passing train, James felt a growing sense of disappointment. Maybe she caught an earlier train, or perhaps she wasn’t even coming. He tried to console himself with his book, but the pages held little appeal now.

As the weeks turned into months, James continued to look for her every Friday, always choosing a seat with a clear view of the waiting room door. Winter edged its icy fingers into Hastings, and the station grew colder, emptier. But no matter the weather, the woman with the red hair and the book of local myths never returned.

James couldn’t help but feel that he had missed a rare opportunity, not just for romance—although the thought had crossed his mind—but for a kind of connection that seemed as precious and as fleeting as a page from an ancient book. He wondered about her, about the stories she loved, about the history she guarded at the old records office. Each unanswered question added a weight to his solitary commutes, a pang of longing for another conversation, another chance.

With spring’s thaw, the routine of his Friday commute had settled back into its old pattern, the interruption of that brief, bright connection fading into the backdrop of his solitary life. But the stories she had shared lingered in his mind, whispers of a past that felt more vivid, more intriguing than ever. And in that lingering interest, James found a new passion for his teaching, bringing tales of local myths and legends into his classroom, watching as his students’ eyes lit up with the same spark he’d seen in hers.

As the seasons changed and the leaves once again began their graceful descent, James found himself drawn to the dusty shelves of the local library more often than not. The mystery of the red-haired archivist had burrowed deep, stirring a hunger for the local lore he had only skimmed the surface of in their brief encounter.

One day, while buried in a stack of books about the ancient customs and spectral legends of Sussex, James stumbled across a volume that seemed to reach out to him from the past. Its leather cover was cracked and worn much like the book the woman had cherished. He pulled it from the shelf, a small cloud of dust rising into the beam of sunlight that cut across the dim aisle. The title was etched in faded gold lettering: "Echoes of the Past." It was an identical copy. His heart raced as he opened it, half-expecting to find a note or a sign that she had been there before him.

Instead, he found annotations in the margins, tiny scribbles in a delicate hand that he imagined might belong to her. Flipping through the pages, James let the whispered myths envelop him, each tale a ghostly caress from a world that felt as close as it did distant. He checked the book out, cradling it on his walk home as if it might dissolve into the crisp autumn air.

That evening, by the light of a small lamp, James delved deeper into the storied past of his town. He read of shipwrecks whispered to be caused by mermaids, of ancient oaks under which lovers swore undying fidelity, and of moonlit dances with creatures that were only part human. Each story seemed to throb with life, a pulse that beat in time with his own.

Days turned into weeks, and James continued his new ritual. Each Friday, he would scour the library for more books, taking them to the platform where he'd first seen her. He read as he waited for trains that still ran late, a part of him always alert to the click of the waiting room door, always hoping for a flash of red hair or the sight of an old book clutched in familiar hands.

In one poignant legend, he read about the "Waiting Widow," a figure said to haunt the Hastings cliffs, searching the churning waters for her lost mariner husband. The tale resonated with him, the longing, the hope, the infinite patience. It was a mirror to his own wait, tinged with the spectral hues of myth.

At school, his passion did not go unnoticed. His enthusiasm breathed new life into the lessons, and his students engaged with history with an eagerness that matched his own. They re-enacted battles, debated the veracity of local ghost stories, and even created a map pinpointing the legendary sites around Sussex. Yet, amidst this animated exploration, James’s thoughts often wandered back to the woman who had ignited this spark.

One particularly blustery Friday, as James approached the station, his heart lodged in his throat. There, under the skeletal branches of a leafless tree, stood the archivist, her red hair less vibrant than his memory painted but unmistakable nonetheless. She was not reading but rather staring out over the tracks, her book hugged against her chest.

James's steps quickened, his previous reservations drowned out by the drumming of his heart. As he drew closer, she turned, a flicker of recognition crossing her features.

"I wondered if I'd see you here again," she said, her voice a soft echo of their last conversation.

"I’ve been here," James replied, a gentle admission. "I found another copy of your book," he confessed, feeling slightly foolish now that the words hung between them.

Her smile then was like the breaking of a long night. "Then perhaps it's time to share another story," she suggested, the wind catching her hair as she gestured to the bench.

As they sat, the train late as ever, James thought about the Waiting Widow, her vigil not in vain, and he wondered if some waits, some hopes, were indeed destined to be fulfilled. As they opened the book together, it no longer mattered; the stories were waiting, and they had all the time in the world.
